# 🛳️ Titanic Dataset – Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## 🔎 Overview
This project performs **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on the Titanic dataset.  
The analysis aims to identify patterns and correlations between passenger demographics, travel class, and survival outcomes.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Understand the distribution of passengers by age, gender, class, and embarkation point
- Analyze survival rates across different categories
- Visualize important relationships and correlations
- Prepare insights for predictive modeling

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries
- Python (Jupyter Notebook)
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## 📂 Project Structure

## 📊 Analysis & Visualizations
- Survival rate by **gender**
- Survival rate by **passenger class (Pclass)**
- Age distribution of survivors vs non-survivors
- Correlation heatmap of numerical features
- Box plots & histograms for feature distributions

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Clone/download this repository
2. Install required Python libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn
Open the notebook in Jupyter:

jupyter notebook "Titanic Dataset EDA.ipynb"


Run all cells to reproduce the analysis

✅ Key Insights

Female passengers had a much higher survival rate compared to males

Passengers in 1st class had better survival chances than those in 2nd or 3rd class

Younger passengers (children) showed relatively higher survival rates

Correlations indicate fare and class were strong indicators of survival

📌 Future Work

Feature engineering for machine learning models

Build classification models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, etc.)

Compare predictive performance across algorithoms
